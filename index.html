        <h1>Project on console</h1>
        <p>First go to <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target = "_blank">Visual Studio Download</a>. Then choose what platform is needed. Then in your finder or file explorer, open a new file and name to whatever you want to name it. This is the file that we will be storing all our projects with Visual Studio. Then open the file and create a file to whatever you want it to be called. Then you need to open Visual Studio and click on the last option. Search for the extension "Live Server". Click on install and it will be installed. Then click on open folder. Then select the name you put as the file for storing all your projects in Visual Studio. Select the file that will be holding the data for that project. Then click open. Now you are ready to get coding.</p>
        <p>How to print things on console. First in your html, open the script tag. Then what you put in next to get the text to appear in the console screen is console.log(*Type in the text you want*) then test it. What you can do to see if it works is you can right click, select inspect, and select console instead of elements. </p>
